For developers
==============

This product's content types were created with ArchGenXML. The model is in the
the UML directory. There's a makefile for generating: cd to Products/Doormat
and run::
    
    make -C ../../uml/

Please keep the UML model up-to-date so AGX code generation keeps working,
unless you have good reason to do so, and please do not use older versions of
AGX than the version it was last generated with.
